LLog
====

I wrote this to prepare for the vocabs for my Japanese final. The vocabs we needed to know are scattered around the textbook and handouts, with different parts of speeches and transformations. I used this to generate a list of vocab sorted by it's part of speech to help me review. I plan to expand the functionality over time - this is just the beginning.

###Note
LLog is slightly specific to Japanese at the moment. I mainly use this to keep track of all the vocabularies I've learned so far, so for each vocab I record the term, part of speech, definition, and its kanji representation if it exists. 

###Usage
There are two ways of initializing the log. 

1.  With a csv file
2.  Manul Entry
  
If you don't want to manually enter everything in command line, you could type in Excel(or equivalent) and generate an csv from there. 

###What's to come
Having to go through Excel and start using LLog is a hassle, but there will be more functionality that help with language learning such as quizzes, printing, etc.
